# Supply Hub - Game Rules

## 1. Objective

*   The main goal is to gather all 15 types of resources and use them to fully upgrade the central Hub building.

## 2. Gameplay Basics

*   All actions take place on a grid.
*   Players select buildings (Miners, Belts, Towers, etc.) and place them onto valid grid tiles.
*   Resources are collected by Miners and transported via Belts to the Hub.

## 3. Resource Nodes

*   Resource nodes appear randomly on unoccupied grid tiles.
*   Each node contains a single type of resource and has a finite amount.
*   Once depleted, the node disappears.

## 4. Building Placement

*   Buildings can only be placed on empty, valid grid tiles.
*   Miners must be placed adjacent to a resource node matching their type.
*   Belts must connect valid input/output points (e.g., Miner output, Hub input, Splitter/Combiner ports).
*   Tesla Towers must be placed within range of a power generator source.

## 5. Miners

*   A specific Miner type is required to extract each resource type.
*   You start with the Miner for the first resource type and must unlock others via Hub upgrades.
*   Miners automatically extract resources if placed correctly and powered (if required).

## 6. Transport Network

*   Belts move items in one direction, indicated visually.
*   Items are placed onto belts by Miners or other belt components.
*   **Belt Speeds:** Higher tiers (unlocked via upgrades) move items faster. Mixing speeds on a connected line may cause backups if feeding a slower belt.
*   **Underground/Over-top Belts:** Require an entrance and an exit point. Allow routing through/over obstacles. Cannot occupy the same tile layer simultaneously.
*   **Splitters:** Take one input belt and distribute items across multiple output belts (e.g., 1-to-2, 1-to-3).
*   **Combiners/Mergers:** Take multiple input belts and merge items onto a single output belt (limited by the output belt's speed/capacity).

## 7. Power System

*   Some buildings (advanced miners, pumps, etc.) require power to function.
*   Power is supplied by Tesla Towers.
*   Tesla Towers must be placed near a power generator (like the Hub or dedicated structures) and project power in a radius (
